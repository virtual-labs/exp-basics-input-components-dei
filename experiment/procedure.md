## Procedure

1. Open the experiment in the virtual lab.  
   The Arduino board and all input components (pushbutton, potentiometer, slider switch, photoresistor) are already connected.

2. Observe the circuit connections.  
   Check how each input component is wired with the Arduino pins.  
   Identify which components use digital pins and which use analog pins.

3. Open and review the Arduino code.  
   Read the predefined code to understand pin configuration, input reading, and serial output.

4. Start the simulation.  
   Click the "Start Simulation" button.  
   Interact with the components (press the button, rotate the potentiometer, toggle the slider switch, and vary the light on the LDR).  
   Observe the readings on the Serial Monitor.

5. Record the observations.  
   Note digital HIGH/LOW outputs for the button and slider switch.  
   Note analog value changes for the potentiometer and LDR.

6. Stop the simulation.  
   Click the "Stop Simulation" button after completing the experiment.
